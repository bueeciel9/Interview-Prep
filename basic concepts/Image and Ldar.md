monocular camera lends itself well to informative color and texture attributes, better visual recognition of text from road signs, and high frame rate at a negligible cost etc. Whereas, it is lack of depth information, which is crucial for accurate location estimation in the real 3D world. To overcome this issue, stereo cameras use matching algorithms to align correspondences in both left and right images for depth recovery. While cameras have shown potentials as a reliable vision system, it is hardly sufficient as a standalone one given that a camera is prone to degrade its accuracy in cases where luminosity is low at night-time or rainy weather conditions occur.

**Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR)** is a point-and-shoot device with three basic components of lens, lasers and detectors, which spits out light pulses that will bounce off the surroundings in the form of 3D points, referred to as “point clouds”. High sparseness and irregularity by nature and the absence of texture attributes are the primary characteristics of a point cloud, which is well distinguished from image array.
 
 
The distance of obstacles could be determined without effort. LiDAR system emits thousands of pulses that spin around in a circle per second, with a 360 degree view of surroundings for the vehicles being provided.
