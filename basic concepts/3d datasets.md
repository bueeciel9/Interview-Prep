KITTI is recorded in daytime on sunny days, without taking lighting and weather conditions into account, resulting a relative lower diversity compared with nuScenes and Waymo Open. Real dataset tends to suffer from class imbalance as it is true to life. According to our statistics in Table 3, 50% categories account for only 6.9% of total annotations, which clearly reflects a long-tail distribution on nuScenes.
