Light Detection
 And Ranging (LiDAR) is a point-and-shoot device with
 three basic components of lens, lasers and detectors, which
 spits out light pulses that will bounce off the surroundings
 in the form of 3D points, referred to as “point clouds”. High
 sparseness and irregularity by nature and the absence of
 texture attributes are the primary characteristics of a point
 cloud, which is well distinguished from image array
